									<h1>Simulation</h1>
									<p>During my research, my coauthors and I have come with<br />
										new ideas for simulation of the cellular inftrastucture in a smart-city in large scaleg.<br />
										In this section I describe briefly the work done in:</p>
										<p>1) A simulation framework based on empirical distributions for large-scale simulation and evaluating the performance of IoT applications</p>
										<p>2) A new approach for parallel (multi-thread) computing for large-scaled cellular inftrastructres with mobility and handovers. </p>
										<p><br /></p>
									

									<h3>1) Parallel computing for large-scale simulation<br />
										of cellular netwroks with handovers</h3>
									<p>This research project presents a very original idea to reduce between 80% and 100% the number of stops in parallel or multi-threading computing
										to perform synchronization stops between the multiple-computing elements or threads, improving dramatically the efficiency of the parallel computing
										efforts</p>

									<p>This is a great idea for systems that require co-sumulation of different levels or dimensions of a problem where the influence of one of the systems on 
										the another one can be considered uni-directional.
									</p>

									<h3>1) Simulation framework for evaluation of IoT performance<br />
											in geographically distributed and LTE-dependent applications</h3>
									<p>This framework allows simulating the telecom performance of those applications without actually simulating in detail the 
											telecom protocols at the MAC layer. The MAC layer is where it's detemined the establishments of connections between
											devices and cellular antennas</p>

								<!--<p>Iterative Linear Programming for Binary Classification is an algorithm that is used to
									 classify data points into two groups based on their characteristics. This algorithm works
									  by adding one separating line or hyper-surface at a time, and each time a line is used to 
									  separate data points, it is placed in a way that on one side of the line there are only
									   data points of one type, and on the other side of the line there are data points of the 
									   other type.</p>
								
								

								<p>Let's imagine we have a bag of beans of different colors, and our goal is to separate them 
									into two groups based on their color. We can start with a separating line that captures
									 as many white beans as possible on one side and leaves a mixture of white and black 
									 beans on the other side. The white beans on one side of the line are now considered classified.</p>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/amsm_beans.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									
								<p>For the remaining beans that have not been classified, we add another line that classifies only 
									black beans, which should capture as many black beans as possible on one side and leave no white 
									beans on that side. We continue the process by adding more lines until all the beans are classified. 
									By assembling a linear piece-wise surface using parts of each of those lines, we will be able to 
									separate all the beans.</p>
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/visual_example_aMSM.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									
								<p>In practice, the algorithm generates with each linear programming model not just a separating line, 
									but a separating n-dimensional 
									surface that can be different from a hyperplane using the "kernel trick" typically used in Support 
									Vector Machines, as long as the resulting transformation is linear with respect to the parameters 
									of the surface.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/amsm_lpmodel.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									
								<p>The importance of this algorithm lies in its ability to classify data points with high accuracy 
									by dividing them into two groups. What makes it different is that it can handle complex data 
									sets by assembling multiple linear surfaces, one at a time. This makes it a valuable tool for 
									many applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. 
									It can also be used to detect fraud in financial transactions, and to predict the likelihood of a 
									customer buying a product.</p>
									
								<p>In conclusion, the Iterative Linear Programming for Binary Classification algorithm is a powerful 
									tool that has broad applications in various fields. Its ability to classify data points with high 
									accuracy, even in complex data sets, makes it an essential tool for data scientists and machine 
									learning engineers.</p>-->
